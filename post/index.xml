      <description>The 2021 Trade Deadline was deadly to Chicago Cubs fans. They did not trade one player, but the core of the team: Anthony Rizzo, Kris Bryant, and Javier Baez. Without them, I believed that there was no way this team could be as good as they once were. So, I decided to see if the Cubs were finished.
The first thing I wanted to see was how the team looked rankings-wise before the trade deadline and after.</description>

      <description>Taylor Edwards and Tristen Edwards. Two sisters who have both played softball at Nebraska and left their names in the record books. Both have proven their power with their bats. But which sister was the more effective hitter?
Let’s take a look and see how they did compare career-wise with hits and runs batted in (RBIs).

      <description>I am going to be cleaning up some text in a football file and create a scatterplot of it.The first step I need to do is include all the libraries I will be using.
